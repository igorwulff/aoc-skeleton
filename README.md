    Update the `go.mod` file with your new module name.
    ```go
    module github.com/yourusername/your-new-repo
    ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    go mod tidy
    ```

4. **Run the application:**
    ```sh
    go run main.go
    ```

## Project Structure

- `main.go`: Entry point of the application.
- `Copy 2024/template folder to 2024/day{number}`
- `2024/day1/part1.go`: Solution for Day 1, Part 1.
- `2024/day1/part1_test.go`: Tests for Day 1, Part 1.
